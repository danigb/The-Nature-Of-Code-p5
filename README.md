## What is this?

This is my own version of [The Nature Of Code](http://natureofcode.com/) examples in [p5.js](http://p5js.org/)

__This is a personal exercise and a work in progress.__

For a reference implementation: https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-Examples-p5.js

There are some differences from the reference implementation:

- Most important, I use the p5 instantiation mode (instead of global mode)
- I want the code [standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) compilant


## How to?

Clone the repo. Install a server (with node or iojs: `npm i -g http-server`) and start it:

```bash
http-server
```
