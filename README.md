## What is this?

This is my own version of [The Nature Of Code](http://natureofcode.com/) examples in [p5.js](http://p5js.org/)

__This is a personal exercise and a work in progress.__ For a reference implementation: https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-Examples-p5.js

There are some differences between the reference implementation and this one:

- Most important, I use the p5 instantiation mode (instead of global mode)
- I want the code [standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) compilant
- The code style is what I use right now, not necessary for newbies


## How to?

Clone the repo and start a http server at root. With node/iojs:

```bash
npm install -g http-server  # installs the server
http-server                 # starts the server
```
